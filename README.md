# HttpsTrigger!

Welcome to this project! Here, we present a comprehensive solution that empowers you to dynamically execute Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines by harnessing the capabilities of parameterized Azure Functions. Our approach not only facilitates the seamless orchestration of ADF pipelines but also takes it a step further by integrating with Key Vault for enhanced security and credentials management.

With this solution, you can effortlessly trigger ADF pipelines through the power of Azure Functions, making your data workflows more flexible and adaptable. The parameterization aspect allows you to customize and fine-tune your pipeline executions based on varying conditions and requirements.

The integration with Key Vault ensures that sensitive information and credentials remain secure and isolated, providing a robust layer of protection for your data operations. This means you can confidently manage your authentication details without worrying about compromising security.

By exploring this project, you'll gain insights into how to set up and leverage parameterized Azure Functions effectively, tapping into the dynamic potential of Azure Data Factory pipelines. The integration with Key Vault demonstrates our commitment to a holistic and secure approach to data management and automation.

Feel free to dive into the documentation and source code, and take advantage of this powerful solution to elevate your Azure Data Factory pipeline executions to new heights of efficiency and security. Your feedback and contributions are highly valued as we strive to continually enhance and refine this project.
